# horiseon-refactor

Here is the refactor of the web application for the marking agency, Horiseon.

This refactor focused on ensuring accessibility standards were met by adding descriptive alt tags for images and icons.

A concise title was added to the head of the page to optimized for search engines.

A correction was made to ensure all link functionality in the web application.

HTML features were changed to semantic HTML features and CSS features were condensed to simplify readability of code. 

Here is an image of the web application:
